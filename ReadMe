COMP 373 - Observer Pattern
The observer pattern is used when there is a one to many relationship
between objects are to be notified,its dependent objects are to be notified automatically.
Observer pattern uses three actor classes. The Observable class with methods to add, remove
and notify observers. The Observer class that is watching the Observable class as it updates. Then 
the MainDisplayObserver class to see the observer in action.In this program, there are two observers 
NewsSubscriber and NewsApplication watching/related to one NewsObserverable class. Therefore,both
NewsSubscribers and NewsApplication are subscribed to the latest news/headlines that the News Station is updating.
A notification will appear per update. In addition, they have the ability to unsubscribe to the latest news/headlines. 
The advantage with the observer pattern is that the subscribers in this case, NewsSubscriber and NewsApplication will
not have to constantly keep on checking if a change has been made.
